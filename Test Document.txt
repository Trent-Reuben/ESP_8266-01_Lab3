Unit Test 1: Set GPIO2 pin high(turn LED ON)

Purpose: Test to ensure the function sets the gpio pin high 
Pre-Conditions: 3V to esp8266-01, working LED
Test Input: Conifgured GPIO2 pin, gpio pin set to 0, call 'gpio_on' function
Expected: LED turns on 
Test Results: LED turned on 
Test Result Evidence: unit_test_1.png

Unit Test 2: Set GPIO2 pin low(turn LED OFF)

Purpose: Test to ensure the function sets the gpio pin low 
Pre-Conditions: 3V to esp8266-01, working LED
Test Input: Conifgured GPIO2 pin, gpio pin set to 1, call 'gpio_off' function
Expected: LED turns off 
Test Results: LED turned off

Unit Test 3: Display of status message

Purpose:  Test to ensure the function displays the  current status of the gpio pin
Pre-Conditions: 3V to esp8266-01, working LED
Test Input: Conifgured GPIO2 pin, gpio pin set to 0, call 'status_msg' function
Expected: status of gpio pin is shown
Test Results: status of gpio pin displayed

Integration Test: Integration of gpio_on, gpio_off and status_msg

Purpose: Test to ensure the functions work sequentially 
Pre-Conditions: 3V to esp8266-01, working LED
Test Input: Conifgured GPIO2 pin, call gpio_on, call status_msg, call gpio_off
Expected: LED light turns on, LED turns off and a status message is diplayed for each change of status
Test Results: LED light turns on, LED turns off and a status message is diplayed for each change of status

Verification Test: Verifying the system meets the specified requirement

Requirements/Specifications: 
1. Turn the GPIO pin on, actively wait for 0.5 seconds, and task-delay for 1 second. 
2. Turn the GPIO pin off, actively wait for 0.5 seconds, and task-delay for 1 second. 
3. The GPIO pin should be managed using a semaphore/mutex. 
4. The third task will print a status message only, and task-delay for 1 second. 
5. Each task should have it's own priority level. 

Purpose: To test the system to ensure it meets the requirements
Test Input: Conifgured GPIO2 pin, call gpio_on, call status_msg, call gpio_off
Expected: LED light turns on for 1.5s, status message is diplayed for 1s, LED light turns off for 1.5s, status message displayed for 1s
Test Results: LED light turns on for 1.5s, status message is diplayed for 1s, LED light turns off for 1.5s, status message displayed for 1s

The verification test and integration test was done simultaneously as the requirements were set prior and implementation was done in order to result in meeting the requirments. The integration test only tested the functions and not the delays while the verification test tested the necessary delay times.
